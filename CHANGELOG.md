## [2026-05-14]

### Changed
- **Topic cover presets — third preset changed to purple**: the teal→green gradient (`#14b8a6` → `#22c55e`) in `COVER_PRESETS` replaced with purple→violet (`#a855f7` → `#7c3aed`) in `script-topics.js`.

### Fixed
- **Edit sub-topic — upload tile text not centred**: `.cover-upload-empty` changed to `position: absolute; inset: 0` with `justify-content: center` so the icon and "UPLOAD" label are vertically and horizontally centred within the tile.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Add with AI — AI flow**: `addTopicAI()` calls `addTopic()` then overrides the badge to "Adding with AI", shows the AI credits pill, hides the "Add sub-topics" tab, and auto-activates the content section (skipping the choice picker). Two-step flow reverted.
- **Content picker — Video URL → Web URL**: the video/URL tab in all content pickers now reads "Web URL" with a link icon (`fa-link`); placeholder updated to `https://…`.
- **Add with AI button**: new `.btn-ai` button added to the topics toolbar (right of "Add Topic"), styled with the same `#ab7197 → #f9604d` left-to-right gradient as the top banner, with a pill radius and animated gradient-shift on hover. Clicking it runs the same Add Topic flow but replaces the panel badge with "Adding with AI" (gradient-filled `.badge-ai` class). `addTopicAI()` added to `script-topics.js`; `#addTopicAIBtn` wired into the scope-enable/disable logic in `script-topics-sidebar-scope.js`; `setPanelMode` clears `.badge-ai` so normal add/edit flows are unaffected.
- **CTA / accent color**: `--accent` updated to `#244173`; `btn-primary` hover updated to `#1a3058`; scope-selected border rgba tints updated to `36, 65, 115`.
- **Sidebar gradient**: updated to `linear-gradient(to bottom, #2e5795 0%, #111935 100%)`.
- **Top accent banner**: a 6 px fixed bar at the top of the content area (starts after the sidebar, not behind it) with a left-to-right gradient (`#ab7197` → `#f9604d`); implemented via `body::before` with `left: var(--sidebar-width)`; `body:has(.sidebar.collapsed)::before` shifts it to `left: 60px` when the nav is collapsed; `.layout` gains `padding-top: 6px`.
- **CTA / accent color**: `--accent` updated to `#3b56bb` (was `#375496`); `btn-primary` hover updated to `#2e44a0`; scope-selected border rgba tints updated to `59, 86, 187`.
- **Sidebar gradient**: `.sidebar` background changed from flat `var(--sidebar-bg)` to `linear-gradient(to bottom, #3b56bb 0%, #111937 100%)`.
- **Sidebar menu text color**: `--sidebar-text` updated to `#c0c6d4` (was `#94a3b8`).
- **Active nav item background**: `.nav-item.active` background updated to `#456eab` (was `#4055a9`).
- **CTA buttons — pill shape**: `border-radius: 9999px` added to `.btn-primary` and `.btn-outline` so primary and Cancel buttons render as fully rounded pills. `.btn-choice` (Add content / Add sub-topics cards) overridden to `border-radius: 10px` and `.btn-add-sub` (dashed add row) to `border-radius: 8px` to preserve their card/tile appearance.
- **Add Topic button — larger size**: `#addTopicBtn` overridden with `padding: 9px 20px` and `font-size: 13.5px` to make it slightly more prominent in the toolbar.
- **Scope card — company brand color**: `renderCard()` in `script-sidebar-scope.js` now applies the company's `color` field as the inline background of the `$logo` element (the top-left initial/avatar box), using `isLightColor` to auto-pick black or white text for legibility.
- **Sidebar background**: `--sidebar-bg` updated to `#24272e`.
- **CTA / accent color**: `--accent` updated to `#375496`; `btn-primary` hover updated to `#2c4280`; `--accent-light` updated to `#e8eef8`; hardcoded blue rgba tints in scope-selected state updated to match.
- **Company brand colors**: added a `color` field to every company in `FALLBACK_COMPANIES` (`script-sidebar-scope.js`) and `SIDEBAR_COMPANIES` (`script-topics-sidebar-scope.js`). `avatarHtml` now applies the brand color as the avatar background; a new `isLightColor` helper picks black or white text for legibility. MTN Group `#ffcc00`, Standard Bank `#005aff`, and five other realistic brand colors assigned.
- **Bulk select — always-visible faint checkboxes**: removed the "Bulk Select" toolbar button. Checkboxes are now always rendered on topic rows at `opacity: 0.2`, rising to `0.5` on row hover and `1.0` when checked. The Disable button still appears only when at least one checkbox is selected. `select-mode` body class and all related CSS rules removed; `toggleBulkSelect` reduced to a reset helper.

### Changed
- **Share icon updated to `fa-people-group`**: replaced `fa-share-nodes` with `fa-people-group` in the tree chip, both kebab menu "Share" items (`script-topics.js`), and the panel topbar badge (`index-topics.html`).
- **Share panel badge — indigo**: `.detail-share-badge` background/text/icon updated from orange to indigo (`#eef2ff` / `#3730a3` / `#6366f1`) in `styles-topics.css`.
- **Shares chip + share panel — orange → indigo, chip style → gray outline**: `.chip-shares` row badge now uses the base gray `.chip` style (white background, gray border/text) with an indigo icon, matching the sub-topics and file-type chips. Share panel: checkbox `accent-color` and `.share-dept-tag` date badge are indigo. Confirm button uses the standard `btn-primary` style.

### Added
- **Share panel — shared date badge**: the "Currently shared" tag on already-shared departments now shows the date the topic was shared (e.g. "12 Apr '26"). `shareTopicWithDepartments` stamps `sharedDate` (ISO string) on the pushed copy; two new helpers `formatSharedDate` and `getSharedDate` in `script-topics.js` look it up and format it. Falls back to "Shared" for topics shared before this change.
- **Add Topic — sub-topic list scrollbar**: `.sub-list` now has `max-height: 210px; overflow-y: auto` so that a sixth sub-topic activates a vertical scrollbar instead of expanding the panel indefinitely.

### Removed
- **Sub-topic cover/thumbnail in add and edit forms**: removed the Cover Image picker from `openSubEditor` (tab flow), `openModuleEdit`, and `addModule` (kebab). Cover data is no longer read, stored, or persisted for sub-topics anywhere (`commitSubEditor`, `appendSubItem`, `readListedSubs`, `saveEdit`, `saveAdd`, `createSubTopicRow`, `subTopicRowHtml`, `snapshotCurrentScope`). The `.sub-list-cover` img element and CSS rule removed from `styles-topics.css`.
- **Sub-topic linked game**: removed the Linked Game field from all sub-topic add/edit forms (`addModule`, `openSubEditor`, `openModuleEdit`), from all row-rendering paths (`createSubTopicRow`, `subTopicRowHtml`), from the staged-list data model (`appendSubItem`, `readListedSubs`, `commitSubEditor`), from `saveEdit`/`saveAdd`, `updateModuleRowChips`, and `snapshotCurrentScope`. The `data-linked-game-id`/`data-linked-game-name` dataset attributes and `chip-game` chips are no longer written anywhere.
- **Sub-topic row thumbnails**: the 28×28 px thumbnail image has been removed from sub-topic rows in both `createSubTopicRow` and `subTopicRowHtml` in `script-topics.js`. Only topic rows retain their thumbnail. The `.row-thumb-sub` CSS rule has been removed from `styles-topics.css`.

### Fixed
- **Add sub-topic (kebab menu) — cover picker missing**: `addModule()` now renders a Cover Image picker above the Sub-Topic Name field, matching the field order used in the edit panel. Cover is passed through to `createSubTopicRow` via `data.get('cover')`.
- **Edit topic/sub-topic — panel stays open after Save**: saving a topic edit now calls `showEmpty()` instead of re-opening `openTopicEdit`. Sub-topic edits already called `showEmpty()`; topic edits now do the same.
- **Sub-topic linked games not persisting**: `subTopicRowHtml` (used by `renderTopicsForScope`) was missing the `data-linked-game-id` and `data-linked-game-name` attributes and the game chip in `.cell-pills`. After a scope re-render the linked game was lost from the DOM even though it was correctly stored in `TOPICS_BY_SCOPE`. Both attributes and the chip are now rendered from the stored `sub.linkedGameId`.

### Added
- **Topics list — inline primary chip**: the sub-topic count badge (topics) and media-type badge (sub-topics) now sit immediately after the row name rather than in the grouped chip area. Descriptions removed from topic rows. Remaining badges (shares, status, game) stay in their existing positions. `updateTopicRowChips` and `updateModuleRowChips` updated to target the new `.row-main-chip` wrapper instead of `.cell-pills`.

- **Add Topic — two-tab panel**: the Add Topic detail panel now has a "Topic" tab (cover, name, description, content choice) and a "Sub-topics" tab (staged list + inline editor). The Sub-topics tab is disabled until the user picks "Add sub-topics", then activates automatically; cancelling back to zero sub-topics re-disables it. The topic mini-card collapse/expand pattern is removed. Tab badge shows the current sub-topic count. Implemented via new `switchAddTab()` in `script-topics.js` and `.add-topic-tabs` / `.add-topic-tab` / `.add-topic-pane` rules in `styles-topics.css`.

- **Removed topic descriptions from list rows**: the inline `.row-description` span has been removed from `topicRowHtml` and `subTopicRowHtml` in `script-topics.js`, and the `.row-description` CSS rule removed from `styles-topics.css`. Descriptions are still stored on the data objects and editable in the detail panel.
- **Topics list — randomized thumbnail colours**: topic and sub-topic thumbnails now pick randomly from the three gradient presets (blue→purple, orange→pink, teal→green) via a new `randomCover()` helper in `script-topics.js`, instead of always showing the blue→purple default.
- **Topics list — square thumbnails**: topic rows show a 36×36 px thumbnail and sub-topic rows a 28×28 px thumbnail, placed between the chevron/connector and the name. All three row-generation paths updated (`topicRowHtml`, `subTopicRowHtml`, `createSubTopicRow` in `script-topics.js`); styled with `.row-thumb` / `.row-thumb-sub` in `styles-topics.css`. Falls back to the default blue→purple gradient when no custom cover is set.
- **Topics list — inline descriptions**: topic and sub-topic rows in `index-topics.html` now show the item's description as muted secondary text immediately after the name. Rendered by `topicRowHtml` and `subTopicRowHtml` in `script-topics.js`; styled with the new `.row-description` rule in `styles-topics.css`. Descriptions truncate with an ellipsis at 260 px so chips/status badges are never crowded out.

- `CLAUDE.md` — onboarding notes for Claude Code covering page/script map, the cross-page scope mechanism, the duplicated company/department reference data, the topics data model, and DevExtreme conventions.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file. All future changes (by the user or by Claude) should be appended here under a dated section.
- Working-agreement section in `CLAUDE.md`: no tests; Tailwind preferred for new styling (target stack Tailwind + DevExtreme + React); project contact pinned to elsadr@agilebridge.co.za; commit-prompt expectation for Claude; no Claude `Co-Authored-By` trailer in commit messages.
- Git repository initialised; default branch renamed to `main`; `user.email` set to `elsadr@agilebridge.co.za`.

### Changed
- `.gitignore` expanded to cover `node_modules/`, `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, and editor swap files (`*.swp`, `*.swo`).
