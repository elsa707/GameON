## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Topics list — inline descriptions**: topic and sub-topic rows in `index-topics.html` now show the item's description as muted secondary text immediately after the name. Rendered by `topicRowHtml` and `subTopicRowHtml` in `script-topics.js`; styled with the new `.row-description` rule in `styles-topics.css`. Descriptions truncate with an ellipsis at 260 px so chips/status badges are never crowded out.

- `CLAUDE.md` — onboarding notes for Claude Code covering page/script map, the cross-page scope mechanism, the duplicated company/department reference data, the topics data model, and DevExtreme conventions.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file. All future changes (by the user or by Claude) should be appended here under a dated section.
- Working-agreement section in `CLAUDE.md`: no tests; Tailwind preferred for new styling (target stack Tailwind + DevExtreme + React); project contact pinned to elsadr@agilebridge.co.za; commit-prompt expectation for Claude; no Claude `Co-Authored-By` trailer in commit messages.
- Git repository initialised; default branch renamed to `main`; `user.email` set to `elsadr@agilebridge.co.za`.

### Changed
- `.gitignore` expanded to cover `node_modules/`, `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, and editor swap files (`*.swp`, `*.swo`).
